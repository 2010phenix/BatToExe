BatToExe – Readme.txt – http://softwarebydefault.com
Thank you for downloading BatToExe! This application is entirely open source and free of charge. 
BatToExe is released under the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL) which can be found at the end of this file. 

The aim of this application is to convert batch files (*.bat) to executable files. 
To get you started copy the following text then paste into a blank text file. 
After saving rename the text file’s extension to .bat:

@echo off
"%SystemRoot%\System32\ipconfig.exe" /all
@pause

Specify your newly created *.bat file as an input batch file to BatToExe.exe, 
then specify a file name and location for the executable file that will be generated. 
If all goes well you should end up with an executable file that performs the exact same function as the original *.bat file.

BatToExe is hosted at http://softwarebydefault.com, the primary online resource for updates, comments or questions.
